        "video_description": "Explore Guitar Wisdom. The easiest way is to click BROWSE, then \"View all\" and \"Show more\" to see each playlist/category in its entirety.\nIf you are a beginner, we recommend that you start with the Beginner Series and the Sight-Reading Series. Both of these Series are arranged sequentially, so that you can follow an established path at the outset.\nGuitarists with some playing experience may want to jump into the Foundation & Technique series and Music Theory I. These lessons are  linear/sequential at the beginning, but they transition to topical lessons.\nThe lessons on Blues, Jazz, Funk, R&B and Improvisation are topical. They are not meant to be followed in any strict order.\n\nThere are many paths to wisdom! The most important thing is to find the one that is right for you! \nIf you are a subscriber, and you need some ideas for creating your own path here, please check out Tomo's video on \"How to Learn with Guitar Wisdom\" (QAP02) in the Q&A/Proficiency section.",
